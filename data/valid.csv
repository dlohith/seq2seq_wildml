i m not refer to travel agenc in general here i narrow it down to travel agenc that sell airplan ticket for hotel it s pretti much understand to me a i alway prefer e g book com over fill out some lousi book form of a certain hotel the middl man here ha a nice tool to visual the hotel posit to compar the price they ha better interfac reput payment system etc etc but when it come to air ticket book i wonder why book through agenc is still a common choic e g for each search in skyscann dozen of agenc come up with their list price pretti often the cheap ticket a advertis by the agenc turn out to be anyth but mani peopl complain about the hassl they had to go through with the agenc sudden cancel the book no actual book found in the airlin s system no support line or chang the trip seem imposs etc perhap this is bias because peopl who went through without any problem would not bother to say oh hey i did it with them perfect no problem but even when consid the price it s not the sell point of the agenc a well person experi today i wa search for the pari osaka ticket some agenc advertis price may sound 60 80 cheaper but go step by step to the payment page an agenc normal add lot of fee and ad the unavoid administr document fee make the total mayb equal or even more than the price if one wa to buy at the airlin sell site unlik hotel seem that almost all airlin compani have a decent sell web and i don t understand how book through agenc is easier either way you ll have to go through step where you fill the name dob passport number phone number address and pay how hard can it be skyscann is live well because the agenc are live well so what is are the agenc sell point s note for me i only use ss a a search engin for refer then go direct to the airlin websit sometim not mani time buy via agenc can actual be quit cheaper perhap they have quota to sell in lot batch but it happen very rare to me

sometim it is desir to identifi a particular train rather than just find any train that travel to a given destin for instanc discount train ticket in germani are usual valid only on a particular train train station display various inform on schedul train and my question refer to that inform i would like to identifi the inform relev for my particular train on such display this question is not about how to recogn the train when it is alreadi wait at the platform a it might be too late then and i like to wait on the platform before the train arriv when travel by train in e g germani and franc inform on train is display along with the uniqu per day number of the train cf e g this display from germani or this one from franc howev in switzerland and in austria the train number seem to be miss cf e g the first photo in this articl from switzerland or this photo from austria or this one also from austria now i might be abl to figur out which one is my train even though it still seem riski to me if an earlier train to the same destin happen to be delay if i know it departur time and it destin howev especi for the destin this is unlik unless i happen to ride that train all the way until it final destin neither am i interest in where the train travel to after i got out nor do i usual even know at least german onlin ticket for train do not indic the final destin of the book train i would have to specif retriev that inform from the onlin itinerari system practic exampl when take an ic train from mannheim blue marker in the map below to mainz green marker depend on the exact time of travel the final destin of these train red orang marker are d sseldorf greifswald hamburg altona magdeburg m nster dortmund cologn and mainz itself while mani of these are at least rough on rout when extrapol the path from mannheim to mainz it is for instanc geograph rather counterintuit to travel toward magdeburg or greifswald orang marker when one want to go to mainz so even if you know where the final destin display for a train is it is by no mean guarante you could without any further info use that inform to determin which train is yours therefor my primari question is how are travel offici suppos to identifi one s train on such display in austria and switzerland what s the idea on how to use the inform display there when the train number is not visibl a secondari question which is kind of contain in the above only if someon happen to know i think it would improv the answer is why train number are not display a well in austria and switzerland a intern sure they must exist obvious so for e g public number german train that cross the border interest the sourc page of that austrian photo also show various display from austria that do show train number so in austria the issu i observ only seem to appli to some station edit while swiss and austrian railway may not offer any ticket bound to specif train german railway sell such ticket for trip to and through austria and or switzerland as such it is usual necessari at some point to identifi a particular german train in a swiss or austrian station edit2 anoth use case would be travel in a group where some peopl board a train at a later time than the other in such a case they would need to make sure they are refer to the exact same train not just a train around a certain time toward a given place
